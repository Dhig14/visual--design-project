<p>Image one was taken in Douglas the Isle of Man. I resized and cropped the image; the original image was 3024x3024 the manipulated image size is 5000x5024. In the original image the sky is dark and cloudy, I decided to change the sky to brighten up the image. I replaced the sky by finding another image with a brighter sky. I used the selection brush tool to select the area around the dark sky and proceeded to take it out of the image. The aim was to make the image of Douglas port look like an inviting place for a tourist to visit. I brightened up the Image further by improving the brightness and contrast using affinity photo. I changed the HSL and color balance. Once the image was brightened, I then removed a few objects from the image. I removed a van, a yellow box, and some road signs therefore the focus wouldn’t be on those objects. I used the healing brush, cloning tool, in painting brush and selection tool during the process. </p>

<p> Image two was also taken in Douglas the Isle of Man. In my web project I am promoting a sunset tour of the Douglas Head lighthouse. Therefore, I manipulated the image to create a darker sunset evening look. I changed the original sky and replaced it with a darker sky from another image, I used the selection brush and cloning tool to achieve this. I adjusted the HSL and color balance to darken the primary colours. Additionally, I used the curve tool to manipulate the brightness range of the image. I resized the image, the original image was 6816x9158 and the manipulated size is 6936x9248.</p>

<p> Image three is also used to promote a tour on the website.  This image is of Marine drive in Douglas the Isle of Man. The original image had road signs, a car and people walking. I removed all the three by using the in-painting brush, and the healing brush. I then used the cloning brush to cover up the area, so it doesn’t look bare. I then accentuated red of the bricks and brought out the red in the flowers and grass. I wanted those areas to stand out, I then used the curves tool to brighten up certain tones within the image. I used the HSL and color balance to tools to brighten up the sky. This created a nice holiday atmosphere within the image to encourage tourist to walk and drive through that area.</p>

<section class= "img">
<p>Image four was taken in Douglas the Isle of Man. My goal was to accentuate the turquoise tones of the sea, to give the image a tropical feel. I used the HSL and color balance adjustment tool to manipulate the colours. I also used the white balance adjustment also. I then used the selection brush tool to select areas around the rocks to darken, which made the green and yellow colours more prominent. I used the in painting brush and cloning tool to correct areas in the sky. This image wasn’t resized and stayed at the original dimesions of 6936x9248.</p>

<p>Image five is a landscape image which was also taken in Douglas the Isle of Man, this image is also used on the tourist website. I used the curves adjustment to brighten the image and take away the dull tones that are present in the original image. I used the selection brush to select the rock area which I darkened using the HSL and color balance tool. I gave the green, blue, and yellow colours a deeper brighter look. I also used the brightness and contrast tool to achieve the results.  I also used the vibrance and saturation tool to add a layer of intensity to the image. </p>

<section class= "img">
<p>Image six was taken in the Seychelles, this image wasn’t used for my web project. The image is of a Hindu temple I came across whilst on holiday. I chose this image because of the many vibrant colours within it. I used the HSL tool to bring out the colours that were looking dull in the original image. I brightened up the sky as certain areas looked dark and dull. I achieved a brighter sky by using the paint brush and the cloning tool to replicate other areas and make use of existing colours within the image to create a realistic sky.   </p>
