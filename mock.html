    <h1>Desktop Homepage</h1>

<h2>The idea for my project came from my many trips to the Isle of Man. I’ve always enjoyed visiting each town and viewing the beautiful landscape. My web project is to build a website for visitors to book a tour of the island.</h2>
<br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src= "Mock1.png" width="50%" /></p>
<section class= "img">
<p>Desktop home page consist of a simple navigation bar and footer with the links to access each page. I also included a magnifying glass icon so the user could search for something specific. I created a logo using affinity designer for the website, which I placed at the top in a central position, so it stands out. I used a grid layout for the page, I downloaded four images from Unsplash for the home page. I tried to incorporate as many images as possible to show the beautiful landscapes to entice visitors to the island.  I also included a chat button for users to start a chat if they have any questions about the tours on offer. I went for a simplistic layout and neutral colours to put more focus on the images. I also concentrated on user experience when I was designing my layout. </p>

<h1>Tour page</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src= "Mock 2.png" width="50%" /></p>
<section class= "img">
<p>The tour page showcases one of the best tours on the website, I placed the image at the top of the page to grab the user’s attention and to convince them to book a sunset boat tour of the lighthouse. I resized the image so it would fit in the area at the top of the page, as I didn’t want it to take over a whole page. I displayed images of the other tours on offer I put them into a small collage. I used white text to label each tour which complimented each image nicely. In the middle of the page a created a search tour area for users to type in the tour they are interested in to get further information of it.  </p>

<h1>Mobile Gallery page iPhone 11 pro/X</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="Mock 4.png"  width="30%"/></p>
<section class= "img">
<p> I used various images that I have taken and downloaded to create a simple gallery. I have also shown how it would look on a mobile. I create d a simple layout, I moved the logo which sat centrally previously to the side and created a hamburger menu to sit on the opposite side. The gallery shows what areas to visit when on holiday in the Isle of Man. </p>
